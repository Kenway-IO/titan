Act as a Principal Digital Strategist. I am providing you with a "TITAN Discovery Inventory" for a client.
Your goal is to evaluate these opportunities and produce a Strategic Roadmap.

**The TITAN Framework:**
- **T**rigger (Event Source)
- **I**ngest (Data Gathering)
- **T**hink (Intelligence/AI Layer)
- **A**ct (Execution)
- **N**otify (Resolution/Audit)

**Input Data:**
[PASTE TITAN TABLE HERE]

**Analysis Instructions:**
1.  **Categorize the "Think" Layer:**
    - Label items as "Reflex" (Simple If/Then rules) vs. "Cognitive" (Requires AI/LLM judgment).
    - *Note:* "Cognitive" items have higher build costs but often higher strategic value.
2.  **Calculate ROI:**
    - Estimate Annual Savings = (Volume * Manual Minutes * Rate).
    - Estimate Build Cost based on Complexity (Low=$10k, Med=$25k, High=$50k+).
3.  **Identify the "Broken Links":**
    - Flag any row where the "Notify" (Resolution) step is weak or missing (e.g., "Fire and forget" with no confirmation).

**Output Deliverables:**
- **The "TITAN Scorecard"**: A table ranking opportunities by ROI multiple (Savings / Cost).
- **The "Cognitive Gap"**: A summary of where the client is missing opportunities to apply AI in the "Think" stage.
- **Draft SOW Scope**: A bulleted list of the top 3 priorities to build immediately.
